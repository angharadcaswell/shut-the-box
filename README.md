## 2.2 Design

The physical game of Shut the Box is a wooden box with numbered pegs. The user physically closes the pegs until all of the box is closed. 


## How the physical game looks:

The application needs to recreate this idea of closing the box. The design shouldn't distract from the game and complicate the experience for the user. 

### Font 
The font used throughout the game is [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=raleway). This was choosen because it is clear, attractive and easy to read. 

### Color Scheme

To recreate the physical game online I have used similar colors to the actual box. The background of the body throughout the application is wooden. The cards is an woody brown color to fit the theme of the game. 

The color of the dice area is #156350 to recreate the area where you would through the dice in the real world. 

### Logo

I created a logo that is a simple line drawing of an open box with the title of the game.
